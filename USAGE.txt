*** HOW IT WORKS ***

 - Ensure your Java Beans adhere to the following simple rules:

    - if you have Collections (List, Vector etc) as fields in your bean
      ensure they have delegate add method. For example:
      
	  @RDFClassType("http://mydomain.org/vocab/Person")
      public class Person {
          private List<Person> knows;
      
          @RDFPropery(properties = "http://xmlns.org/foaf/01/knows")
          public List<Person> getKnows() {
              return knows;
          }
    
          public boolean addKnow(Person person) {
              return knows.add(person);
          }

    }
    
    Please notice that the delegate method MUST be singular 
    if the setter and getter are plural (without the ending 's').

   - Java primitive types are serialized according the specified ValueTypeHandler 
     implementations, classes marked with the @RDFClassType will be recursevely 
     serialized while a method will be called on unmarked 
     objects and serialized as untyped Literals.
